    I work at the intersection of AI and perceptual image processing, with a focus on enhancing the visual quality of images and videos.
    My research explores lightweight and efficient solutions for mobile platforms, aiming to deliver high-quality results even under strict resource constraints.
    I am particularly interested in applying AI models to enhance the perceptual quality of images and videos.
    I am open to discussing potential collaborations and future research directions.
